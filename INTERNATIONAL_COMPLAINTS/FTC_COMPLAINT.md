## WHAT HAPPENED

### Summary:
After an armed robbery in the Philippines where my device was stolen, I immediately contacted Apple to secure my account. Despite tracking the device to Singapore via "Find My," Apple FAILED to lock my account. This allowed criminals to:

1. Install malicious apps (HILO, FALLA)
2. Process 20+ fraudulent transactions in a single day
3. Steal a total of **SAR 600,000 (~$160,000 USD)**

### Apple's Failures:
- No fraud detection on repeated identical charges
- No geographic anomaly detection
- Ignored explicit requests to lock account
- Continued processing payments after robbery report

### Google's Failures:
- Approved HILO app despite malicious SDK
- Failed security review
- Did not remove app after fraud reports
