NOTICE OF DEMAND

I, Suliman Nazal Alshammari, hereby provide formal notice to Apple Inc. 
and Apple Operations International Ltd. regarding critical security 
failures and resulting financial damages.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND:

1. Following an armed robbery in the Philippines, my iPhone and Apple ID 
   account (logo403@icloud.com) were compromised.

2. I immediately contacted Apple Support to request:
   - Remote lock of the compromised account
   - Freeze on all payment transactions
   - Investigation of unauthorized access

3. Apple REFUSED to lock the account, claiming remote locking was 
   "not possible."

4. Subsequently, 27+ unauthorized transactions totaling SAR 600,000 
   (~USD $160,000) were processed through Apple Pay, including:
   - TikTok Coins purchases (SAR 133.99 each, multiple per hour)
   - HILO in-app purchases
   - All originating from Singapore IP addresses

5. Despite the device being tracked to Singapore while I remained in 
   Riyadh, Apple's fraud detection systems failed to trigger any alerts.

LEGAL VIOLATIONS:

1. GDPR Article 32: Failure to implement appropriate technical measures
2. GDPR Article 33: Failure to notify of security breach
3. Saudi Consumer Protection Law: Breach of duty of care
4. California Consumer Privacy Act: Failure to implement reasonable security

DEMANDS:

1. Full refund of SAR 600,000 in unauthorized transactions
2. Written explanation of security protocol failures
3. Access logs from Singapore IP addresses
4. Confirmation of security improvements

DEADLINE:

You have FORTY-EIGHT (48) HOURS from receipt of this notice to respond 
with a substantive plan to address these demands.

CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE:

Failure to respond will result in:
1. Formal complaint to Ireland Data Protection Commission (GDPR)
2. Report to FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)
3. Complaint to Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
4. Media disclosure of investigation findings
5. Civil litigation in appropriate jurisdiction

This notice is sent without prejudice to any additional legal rights 
and remedies available.

Respectfully,

Suliman Nazal Alshammari
KHAWRIZM
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
