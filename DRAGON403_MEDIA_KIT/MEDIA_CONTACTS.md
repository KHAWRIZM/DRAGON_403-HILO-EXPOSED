Subject: EXCLUSIVE: Technical Evidence of Apple/Google SDK Complicity in $160K HILO Fraud

Hi,

I am Suliman Alshammari (KHAWRIZM), the engineer who exposed Hotmail 
infrastructure vulnerabilities in 2011. I am currently documenting a $50M+ 
fraud network (HILO App) operating with SDK-level access on the App Store 
and Google Play Store.

THE STORY:
Following an armed robbery, Apple refused to lock my compromised account, 
allowing 27 high-velocity transactions totaling SAR 600,000 (~$160,000) to 
be processed from a Singapore IP while I was in Riyadh.

THE EVIDENCE:
- Decompiled SDK code showing GDPR violations (IMEI, VPN detection)
- Server infrastructure mapping (Hong Kong, Singapore)
- Transaction records and Apple correspondence
- Live investigation portal: https://dragon403.com

WHY NOW:
A formal legal notice to Apple (January 17) expired without response. 
I am preparing filings with Ireland DPC, FBI IC3, and FTC.

Full media kit and technical documentation available on request.

The desert is building its own sun. Are you ready to cover the technical reality?
